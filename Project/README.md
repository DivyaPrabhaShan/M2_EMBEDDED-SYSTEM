# COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION
   * Li ION BATTERY
      A lithium-ion battery or li-ion battery is a type of rechargable batteries composed of cells in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to the positive electrode during discharge and back when charging.Lithium-ion batteries use an intercalated lithium compound as the material at the positive electrode and typically graphite at the negative electrode.
   * VOLTAGE SENSOR
      Voltage sensors are wireless tools that can be attached to any number of assests ,machinery or equipment.They provide 24/7 monitoring,constantly watching for voltage data that could indicate a problem.Voltage sensors detect magnetic fields,electromagnetic fields and measure contact voltage.
   * CURRENT SENSOR
        A current sensor is a device that detects and converts current to an easily measurable output voltage.which is proportional to the current through the measured path.There are a wide variety of sensors and each sensor is suitable for a specific current range and environmental condition.
   * RELAY
        A relay is an electrically operated switch.It consists of a set of operating contact terminals.The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms such as make contacts,break contacts.
   * DISPLAY
        A display is a computer output surface and projecting mechanism that shows text and often graphic images to the computer user. 
   * LED/BUZZER
        Light emitting diode is a device that produces a light on electrical and electronic equipment.
   * DC MOTOR
        A Direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.DC motors take electrical power through direct current,and covert this energy into mechanical rotation.   
   * MICROCONTROLLER
         Microcontroller is an integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and that controls some or all of the function of an electronic device.
 # ADVANTAGES
    *  Capital cost and maintanence cost.
    *  Non stop driving,even though the battery gets discharged
    *  Battery powered electric vehicle is considered as one of the solutions to deal with climate change issue since it has zero emission.
