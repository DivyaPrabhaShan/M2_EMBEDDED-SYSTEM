# PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE OF ELECTRIC CAR BATTERY USING IOT
  # DESCRIPTION
     Electric vehicle are made up of two main components. BLDC motor as best motor and the battery is used for energy storage device.. The design of the device is necessarily optimized to optimize the use of batteries and is designed to monitor and detect interruptions or damage to the batteries used in electric vehicle. The BMS system parameters used in the design are voltage, current, temperature and battery capacity. In addition, by optimizing the use of the battery, all parameters are managed by the wifi communication.They will be displayed wifi communicate on the Android smart phone and it will check that the vehicle is working and will notify you when the battery is dead or in good condition. 
  # ABSTRACT
     The battery management system (BMS), what are different parts of it. In this paper, several methods used in battery balancing will be discussed and compared on their advantages & limitations .Among all the conventional methods, how the solar-powered balancing method is most efficient is justified. This method is based on three modes: Load cell -balancing mode, in this mode, the solar panel will balance the battery cells directly. This mode can be used in sunny weather condition and when the vehicle is in running, the discharge rate of the battery is high. The cells with the lowest SOC which is detected by the control unit can be charged by a solar panel. The second mode is Storage balancing mode, this mode is used in rainy or cloudy weather conditions or during the night when the solar panels are not able to generate sufficient power. Then charge stored in the storage cell is passed to the battery module where it charges the cells with lower SOC value. And the third method is Charge balancing mode, Here the battery module is recharged by a plug-in charger. And this method yields an efficiency of the battery module which increases by 2.1 to 3.1%.
