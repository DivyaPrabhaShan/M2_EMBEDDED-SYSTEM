# PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE OF ELECTRIC CAR BATTERY USING IOT
  # DESCRIPTION
     Electric vehicle are made up of two main components. BLDC motor as best motor and the battery is used for energy storage device.. The design of the device is necessarily optimized to optimize the use of batteries and is designed to monitor and detect interruptions or damage to the batteries used in electric vehicle. The BMS system parameters used in the design are voltage, current, temperature and battery capacity. In addition, by optimizing the use of the battery, all parameters are managed by the wifi communication.They will be displayed wifi communicate on the Android smart phone and it will check that the vehicle is working and will notify you when the battery is dead or in good condition.
