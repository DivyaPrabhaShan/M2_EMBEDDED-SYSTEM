 # COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION
   # LITHIUM-ION BATTERY
      * A lithium-ion battery is a type of rechargable batteries composed of cells in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to the positive electrode during discharge and back when charging.Lithiun-ion batteries use an intercalated lithium compound as the material at the posiotive electrode and typically graphite at the negative electrode.
   # VOLTAGE SENSOR
      * Voltage sensors are wireless tools that can be attached to any number of assests,machinery or equipment.They provide 24/7 monitoring,constantly watching for voltage data that could indicate a problem.Voltage sensors detect magnetic field,electromagnetic fields and measure contact voltage.
   # CURRENT SENSOR
      * A current sensor is a device that detects and converts current to an easily measurable output voltage.which is proportional to the current through the measured  path.
   # RELAY
      * A relay is an electrically operated switch.It consist of a set of operating contact terminals.The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contacts forms such as make contact,break contact.
   # DISPLAY
     * A display is a computer output surface and projecting mechanism that shows text and often graphic images to the computer user.
   #  DC MOTOR
     * A direct drive motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.DC motors take electrical power through direct current ,and convert this energy into mechanical rotation.
   # MICROCONTROLLER
     * Microcontrollers is an integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and that controls some or all of the function of an electronic device.
   # LED 
     * Light Emitting diode is a device that produces a light on electrical and electronic equipment.
   # BMS SYSTEM
     * BMS is designed based on device requirements and implementation. The basic theory of the applied technical solution is determined based on device implementation possibility.It is expected that the device design solution approach can compromise between the theory being used.Battery pack was monitored can conditioned by the software and supported by the hardware of BMS.Battery conditions monitored include voltage ,current,and temperature.
