   * It ios cost effective and reduces the manual work and saves time.
   * It is designed to check the water level with the use of wifi module.
   * This system checks the level of the water ,temperatur along with PH level of water.
   * The data of the water is collected and sends to the smart phone with the help of cloud technology.

# REQUIREMENTS
# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
| HLR | DESCRIPTION |
|-----|-------------|
|H_01| The level of water is monitered|
|H_02| PH level of the water is monitered|
|H_03| Temperature of the water is monitered|
# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
|LLR|HLR|DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|-----------|
|L_01|H_01| If there is no water it sends messegto to the smart phone|
|L_02|H_01| The level of the water is low it sense and gives data to smart phone |
|L_03|H_01| The level of water is in correct proportion it sends the message |
|L_04|H_01| If the water is in high level it alerts  |
|L_05|H_02| It sense the PH level of water,it says whether it is above neutral level of PH|
|L_06|H_02| It send message it it is below netral level of ph|
|L_07|H_02| It sends whether it is in a neutral level| 
|L_08|H_03| It shows the condition of temperature leve of water|
